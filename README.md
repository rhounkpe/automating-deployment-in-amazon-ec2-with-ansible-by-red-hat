# Automating Deployment in Amazon EC2 with Ansible
## By Red Hat
### Course by Chris Caillouet

## Description
Learn how to automate creation and provisioning of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances using Ansible. In this course, we use Ansible to provision a virtual private cloud (VPC) and multiple Amazon EC2 instances, find existing Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) and create custom AMIs automatically, dynamically create Ansible inventories of running instances, and clean up all cloud resources when we are done with them.
